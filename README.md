I made this thing to complain about how hot its been lately, summer sucks.

![diagram1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skittlemittle/weather-meme/main/graffics/diagram1.jpg)

It measures:

- temperature
- humidity
- wether it is raining or not (look outside a window lmaoaaaa)
- pressure (soon)

When you go close to it itll just show you a bunch of numbers or smth doesnt matter,
  but if you stand at a distance(> 40cm) and admire the "weaher "station"" it fills up its
8x8 led matrix with colors showing you the history(the past 64 days) of how much the weather
sucked ass.

But what do the colors mea??????n!

the color | what it do be meaning tho
----------|-----------
red       | more red = more bad
green     | le humidity
blue      | how long it was raining today innit

## I made a plate of SPAGHET!

remember the old somebody toucha my spaghet meme? that was a good meme.

Ok so if you wanna change what the colors mean because you disagree with me on what good
weather is just go and completely rewrite `calculateDayColor()` in `rating.cpp`
